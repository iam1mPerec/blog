Dear Grandma 

So you want to start using 
[olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) to write your awesome game.
Fair enough. Where would I advise you to start?  
Well how about a strategy pattern?

So in your game you might have a start menu with options like:  
* start
* load
* quit

very basic staff.
