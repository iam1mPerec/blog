So let's say we want to build a web page this time.
We can write a little HTML. Add a little CSS.
It might be that we even use SASS to make our CSS some what better and more readable and better... just... better.
Now if you have worked with CSS already chances are you know that a lot of times you might run into different problems such as:

* specificity (ids override whatever you have in your class styling, classes override whatever you have in your element tags styling and so on)
* naming (how do i name elements? May be I've used btn for like 5 different elements already)
* nasting (nasting is helpful feature in SCSS but it does get unreadable really quickly)
* !important (useful sometimes but should generally be avoided)
* ids (usually should be left for JS and not be used in styling)

You might find yourself thinking: "there has got to be a better way!" And there is.

**BEM** is a naming convention to organize your code and we all can use some order in our code.
So let's have a look at how this naming convention can help us make our code somewhat more readable and easier to write by hurting your inner sense of beauty.

```scss
.check-list {
  //styling

  .check-list__header {
    //some more styling
    .check-list__header__highlighted {
      //some more styling
    }
  }

  .check-list__item {
    //some more styling

    .check-list__item__checked {
      //some more styling
    }
  }

  .check-list__footer {
    //even more styling
  }
}
```
that code could be further improved with an &. an & in SCSS copies the parent class. So here is what we can do.

```scss
.check-list {
  //styling

  &__header {
    //some more styling
    &__highlighted {
      //some more styling
    }
  }

  &__item {
    //some more styling

    &__checked {
      //some more styling
    }
  }

  &__footer {
    //even more styling
  }
}
```

So let's go through this example. 
We have a check-list class. We can use it multiple times in different places of our website.
In BEM this part is called **block**.

The block is divided into smaller elements that make it. It can exist without them eg. may be in some parts of our website
checklist would not have a footer. but check-list__footer can not exist without a checklist. check-list__footer in this case would be an **element**.

And lastly we have thing's like .check-list__header__highlighted or .check-list__item__checked. They are used to modify an element and are called **modificators**.

So as you can see BEM makes classes names more descriptive.

Let's see how BEM solves your styling problems:

* **specificity** - your class names are painfully specific and are defined in a single block so specificity should not be an issue anymore.
* **naming** - you need a button inside a block just name your class BLOCK-NAME__btn and your good to go.
* **nasting** - usually you would have a block with a number of elements with a number of modificators nested into one another instead of having cases like 30 nastings
* **!important** - no need to use !important for anything but some rear cases of overlapping.
* **ids** - no need to use ids when class names are so specific.

hope this post was helpful and you give BEM a go in your future project.
