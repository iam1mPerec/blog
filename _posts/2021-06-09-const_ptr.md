What do we mean when we are talking about const pointers?   

It can potentialy mean 3 different things:

* **You don't want a pointer to ever change the value it points to**
* **You don't want a pointer to ever point to something else**
* **You don't want the pointer to ever change anything**

So let's see how we can tell pointer to do this 3 things.  
For simplicity we will use pointer to int as an example

##### **You don't want a pointer to ever change the value it points to:**

```c++
int x = 5;
const int * ptrX = &x;
*ptrX = 10 //compilation error
ptrX = nullptr //works fine
```

##### **You don't want a pointer to ever point to something else:**

```c++
int x = 5;
int * const ptrX = &x;
*ptrX = 10 //works fine
ptrX = nullptr //compilation error 
```

##### **You don't want the pointer to ever change anything:**

```c++
int x = 5;
const int * const ptrX = &x;
*ptrX = 10 //compilation error
ptrX = nullptr //compilation error
```
Be good
