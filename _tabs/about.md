This blog is a platform for me to share my thoughts and
ideas about programming. 
Sometimes in my coding journey I would stumble upon something exciting and
there would be no one to share it with. And that is a shame since I find
that sharing and discussing staff is the best way to structure it in your own
head. 
I know that I have a lot to learn and sometimes I would revisit a post and rewrite it.
I also hope that maybe someone would find some interesting ideas or practices to use in their work.


On principal I am trying to make this blog posts as simple as humanly possible, so that my grandma
would be able to understand it. It's a high goal, but I find that unless you can explain something in simplest of terms you do not fully understand it.
Hope you'll have as much fun reading this blog as I have writing it.
All comments are appreciated except for spam ofc.
